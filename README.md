# Literal Sky Block Fabric

This is a port and expansion of [nanite/Literal-Sky-Block](https://github.com/nanite/Literal-Sky-Block).

## Blocks

This mod adds three blocks. A mod like [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi) is recommended to see the crafting recipes for the blocks.

+ Sky Block &mdash; A block that shows the sky through it
+ Void Block &mdash; A block with an effect similar to an End portal
+ Vantablack &mdash; A block that is completely solid black

The Sky Block and Void Block can be toggled on and off by powering them with redstone.
